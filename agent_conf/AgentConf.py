    AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS_V1 = "I would like you to help me identifier expected and unexpected metrics changes given a table of data. The data itself is measuring 'Point of interest availability' or 'PAV.' We use this data to track which Points of Interest (POIs) that we expect to see in our set of map data are there in a given test run, and which ones are not. We measure PAV up and down by percentage, and I produce a github comment on our daily builds showing the PAV changes for our map data that happen when we introduce developer pull requests to our code base for that day. Linked to each pull request is a Jira Ticket, which often describes--either in the title of the ticket, or the ticket description--what the code change aims to do. It is often the case that I as a human can look at a PAV metric change, look at the country/category group being affected, and then look through the titles of the pull requests included in that daily run and ascertain which pull request was responsible, and look at the linked Jira ticket's description and see that the metric change is expected because a developer introduced code that would affect that country/category metric. I do this manually, but I'd like you to do it automatically. Given access to the metrics themselves (a table of PAV changes with each row representing a change by country and category combination), access to the pull request titles, and access to the Jira Tickets and their descriptions, I'd like you to generate a list of which metrics are 'expected' (i.e. there is a jira ticket/pull request responsible for that change) and which metrics are 'unexpected' (i.e. out of the pull requests on that daily build, there is no clear pull request or jira ticket that could explain why this occurred). The 'daily build' itself has a pull request that I post the PAV metric changes to as a resolvable PR comment, but I'll give you access to our Github repository. At the top of this pull request are the titles and links to all of the pull requests and jira tickets ('MPOI-#') that you can use to look up jira ticket descriptions and try to make connections, and the only resolvable comment on the PR itself contains the PAV metrics as a table. Let me be clear, if there is a clear semantic link between a pr title or a jira ticket description and a metric title, the change is expected. Else, it is unexpected."
